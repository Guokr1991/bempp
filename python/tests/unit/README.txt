These tests use the py.test package (http://pytest.org). To execute them, build 
BEM++, cd to the <build_root>/python/tests subdirectory and run the run_tests.py
script, which contains a standalone, pickled version of py.test and 
automatically executes tests in Python scripts whose names start with "test".
