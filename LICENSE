BEM++ consists of a main library (situated under lib and under python), 
and several support libraries with various licenses. 
The following gives a summary of the licenses of BEM++ and the various components

BEM++ main library: MIT License
Alugrid: GPL v2
Armadillo: Mozilla Public License 2.0
Boost: Boost Software License
Dune: GPL v2 with runtime exception
Intel Threading Building Blocks: GPL v2 with runtime exception
Eigen3: MPL2

The license of the complete BEM++ package including all components
is GPL v2 due to the inclusion of Alugrid. Other Dune compatible
grid managers with different license can be enable by editing the file 
dune.hpp in the lib/grid subdirectory.

In the following we summarize the license text of the various components.

================================


Dune (www.dune-project.org)

The DUNE library and headers are licensed under version 2 of the GNU General
Public License, with a special exception for linking and compiling against DUNE,
the so-called "runtime exception." The license is intended to be similiar to the
GNU Lesser General Public License, which by itself isn't suitable for a template
library.

The exact wording of the exception reads as follows:

   As a special exception, you may use the DUNE library without
   restriction.  Specifically, if other files instantiate templates or
   use macros or inline functions from one or more of the DUNE source
   files, or you compile one or more of the DUNE source files and link
   them with other files to produce an executable, this does not by
   itself cause the resulting executable to be covered by the GNU
   General Public License.  This exception does not however invalidate
   any other reasons why the executable file might be covered by the
   GNU General Public License.

This license clones the one of the libstc++ library. For further implications
please see the license page of libstdc++.

================================

Intel Threading Building Blocks (threadingbuildingblocks.org)

The open-source version of Intel TBB is licensed under GPL v2 with a runtime
exception. Details can be found at

Trilinos (www.trilinos.org)
