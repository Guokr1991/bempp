Foamgrid (https://users.dune-project.org/projects/dune-foamgrid)

The dune-foamgrid library, headers and test programs are copyrighted free software. You
can use, modify and/or redistribute it under the terms of either one of the two
following licenses:

* The GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software
  Foundation, either Version 3 of the license or (at your option) any later
  version. You can find a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License, Version
  3, in the files GPL-3 and LGPL-3 or at <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0>.

* Version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
  Foundation, with the following special exception for linking and compiling
  against the dune-foamgrid library, the so-called "runtime exception":

    As a special exception, you may use the dune-foamgrid source files as part of a
    software library or application without restriction.  Specifically, if other
    files instantiate templates or use macros or inline functions from one or
    more of the dune-foamgrid source files, or you compile one or more of the dune-foamgrid
    source files and link them with other files to produce an executable, this
    does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be covered by the GNU
    General Public License.  This exception does not however invalidate any
    other reasons why the executable file might be covered by the GNU General
    Public License.

  This license is intended to be similar to the GNU Lesser General Public
  License, Version 2, which by itself isn't suitable for a template library. You
  can find a copy of the GNU General Public License, Version 2, in the file
  GPL-2 or at <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0>.

Dune (www.dune-project.org)

The DUNE library and headers are licensed under version 2 of the GNU General
Public License, with a special exception for linking and compiling against DUNE,
the so-called "runtime exception." The license is intended to be similiar to the
GNU Lesser General Public License, which by itself isn't suitable for a template
library.

The exact wording of the exception reads as follows:

   As a special exception, you may use the DUNE library without
   restriction.  Specifically, if other files instantiate templates or
   use macros or inline functions from one or more of the DUNE source
   files, or you compile one or more of the DUNE source files and link
   them with other files to produce an executable, this does not by
   itself cause the resulting executable to be covered by the GNU
   General Public License.  This exception does not however invalidate
   any other reasons why the executable file might be covered by the
   GNU General Public License.

This license clones the one of the libstc++ library. For further implications
please see the license page of libstdc++.

Intel Threading Building Blocks (threadingbuildingblocks.org)

The open-source version of Intel TBB is licensed under GPL v2 with a runtime
exception. Details can be found at
