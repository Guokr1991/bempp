The project is currently in its planning phase. Coding is planned to start
October 2011.

COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION

1. Create a subdirectory, e.g. "build", in the main "bempp" directory. cd to the directory you created.

cd bempp
mkdir build
cd build

2. Inside the new directory, run CMake. You can control the build configuration (Debug/Release/...) with the -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE option. By default, CMake will generate standard Makefiles (at least in Linux). You can produce e.g. an Eclipse project (convenient for source browsing and debugging) with the "-G 'Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles'" options.

cmake ..

or e.g.

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G 'Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles' ..

Note: you can have multiple build configurations simultaneously in different build directories.

By default, unit tests are built (this requires the Boost Test Library to be installed). This can be switched off with -DWITH_TESTS=OFF.

3. Compile the sources with 

make

4. (Optional) Build the documentation with 

make doc

(requires Doxygen to be installed).

5. (Optional) Run all unit tests with

make test

Note that currently there is one test that (deliberately) fails.

6. (Optional) Install the library and header files with

make install

(must be run as root).

7. (Optional) Uninstall the library and header files with

make uninstall



CONFIGURATION OF ECLIPSE

1. Follow the first two steps of the procedure above.

2. Open eclipse. Click "File | New | C++ Project".

Choose a project name, unselect "Use default location" and specify the path to the cloned "bempp" directory. Select "Makefile project | Empty project | -- Other Toolchain --". Click "Next >".

Click "Advanced settings". 

Click "C/C++ Build". Unselect "Use default build command". In the field "Build command" enter "make -C make -C ${ProjDirPath}/<build_dir> VERBOSE=1", where <build_dir> is the name of the directory in which you ran CMake previously. In the "Build directory" enter "${ProjDirPath}/<build_dir>" (if this is not done, Eclipse will fail to find executables for running/debugging). Click "OK".

Click "Finish".

If desired, multiple configurations (e.g. for release and debug) can be created by clicking "Project | Build Configurations | Manage...".

3. Right-click the project name in the "Project explorer" tab on the left-hand side of the Eclipse window and select "Team | Share project...". Select "Git", click "Next". Select "Use or create repository in parent folder of project" and the "bempp" item in the list. Click "Finish".

You can check that Git integration works by right-clicking the README file in the Project explorer and choosing "Team | Show in history". A list of previous modifications of the README should be shown.
